# Hush Time

How do you stay focused to get quality work done? The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a great way. Simply setting focused blocks of time for yourself is another.

However you do it, distractions always seem to pop up and ruin the flow of deep, focussed work. Social networks. Email. Instant messages. You need to keep them quiet. But you can't just close them, can you? Forgetting that your email has been closed for the past two days while everyone is relying on you to fight fires is an easy way to lose your job!

*Hush Time* is there to keep those pesky apps from interrupting your flow. Select the apps you'd like to close. Choose a duration for your focussed block of time. Hit Start, and you're ready to go. All your distractions will be closed, and will only open at the end of the duration you chose.
